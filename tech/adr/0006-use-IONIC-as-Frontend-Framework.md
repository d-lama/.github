# Use IONIC as Frontend Framework

## Context and Problem Statement

In the frontend team, the decision was made to develop with [REACT](https://react.dev/). However, the question arose whether we wanted to use a UI- framework for this, and if so, which one. The three UI- frameworks Ionic, React-Native and Material were analysed for their opportunities and risks.

## Considered Options

* [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) is an open source framework that is easy to learn and use.
* [REACT native](https://reactnative.dev/) is also an open source framework developed by Facebook
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)  is a design system developed by Google

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/), because

* [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) is a framework for developing hybrid apps that can run on both iOS and Android. By using Ionic with [REACT](https://react.dev/) , developers can create cross-platform mobile apps.
* [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) offers a wide range of pre-built UI components such as buttons, forms, navigation elements and much more. These components are optimised for mobile apps and allow developers to work faster and more efficiently. By using [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) with [REACT](https://react.dev/) , developers can integrate these components into their [REACT](https://react.dev/)  apps, speeding up user interface development.
* Using [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) with [REACT](https://react.dev/) can simplify hybrid app development because developers don't have to create separate codebases for iOS and Android. Instead, they can use a common codebase that provides cross-platform support.


### Consequences

After analysing the three frameworks, the frontend team decided to use the [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) framework for the development of the D- Lama frontend. Since [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) was developed especially for the use of mobile-first applications, can be developed across all platform and is easy to learn even for beginners, it is the ideal Ui framework for D-Lama.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: IONIC

* **Good**, because [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) is an open source framework that is easy to learn and use.
* **Good**, because [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) contains an extensive library of ready-made components.
* **Good**, because with [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) it is possible to develop applications across platforms.
* **Good**, because [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) has sufficient support for questions or problems due to the active developer community.
* **Bad**, because [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) can be slower for complex applications compared to competing products because [IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) develops hybrid apps.


### Option 2: REACT native

* **Good**, because [REACT native](https://reactnative.dev/) enables the development of cross-platform mobile apps for iOS and Android.
* **Good**, because [REACT native](https://reactnative.dev/)  has many ready-made components, rapid development of the application is possible.
* **Good**, because [REACT native](https://reactnative.dev/) enables fast app performance as it is compiled natively.
* **Bad**, because although [REACT native](https://reactnative.dev/) is cross-platform, platform-specific code may still be written to implement certain functions. 

### Option 3: Material design

* **Good**, because [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) is supported by Google and is a widely used design system for Android apps. There are many tools, resources and communities.
* **Good**, because [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)  also offers many pre-built components that helps to create quickly an application without having to build from scratch. 
* **Bad**, because [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) is very precise and uniform, which makes it more difficult to create a unique and individual application.
* **Bad**, because adapting the ready-made components of [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)  to the specific requirements of an application can be difficult.
