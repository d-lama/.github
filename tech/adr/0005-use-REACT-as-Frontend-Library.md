# Use REACT as Frontend Library

## Context and Problem Statement

We would like to use a library to develop the frontend of the web app D-LAMA. The recommendations and wishes of the project partner,
(ZHAW School of Engineering, Centre for Artificial Intelligence, Katsiaryna Mlynchyk) but also the experience of the individual frontend developers, should be taken into account.

## Considered Options

* [REACT](https://react.dev/) - The JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces
* [Angular](https://angular.io/) - The web development JavaScript framework for building the future


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: [REACT](https://react.dev/), because

* Our project partner suggested [REACT](https://react.dev/) to us because they would like to further develop our prototype after the end of the project, and they consider [REACT](https://react.dev/) to be very suitable for this.
* All three frontend developers have a basic knowledge of [REACT](https://react.dev/) and see the training as feasible without existing experience and good progress as realistic.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: REACT

* **Good**, because [REACT](https://react.dev/) can be loaded quickly and therefore shines as a very lightweight library, resulting in responsive web applications.
* **Good**, because [REACT](https://react.dev/) allows to create components and reuse them in different parts of an application, which increases the maintainability and scalability.
* **Good**, because [REACT](https://react.dev/) uses a virtual DOM that efficiently updates changes in the DOM, which improves the speed and performance of web applications.
* **Good**, because [REACT](https://react.dev/) has a large community that is constantly developing new tools, libraries and extensions to facilitate the development of [REACT](https://react.dev/) applications.
* **Bad**, because [REACT](https://react.dev/) uses a new concept of component-based user interface development. Therefore, it can take some time to get used to it.
* **Bad**, because [REACT](https://react.dev/) has no official documentation, which sometimes makes it difficult to find answers to specific questions or problems.

### Option 2: Angular

* **Good**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/)  is very modular and allows to split applications into smaller, reusable components, which increases the maintainability and scalability.
* **Good**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/)  offers many tools and functions that speed up the development of applications and increase productivity.
* **Good**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/)  is strongly typed and provides a clear structuring of code, which improves the readability and maintainability of applications.
* **Good**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/) has a large community that is constantly developing new tools, libraries and extensions to facilitate the development of Angular applications.
* **Bad**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/)  has a complex syntax that can be difficult for beginners to learn.
* **Bad**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/)  can be complex to configure, and setting up development and testing environments can require more time and resources than other frameworks.
* **Bad**, because [Angular](https://angular.io/) sometimes has difficulty working with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
