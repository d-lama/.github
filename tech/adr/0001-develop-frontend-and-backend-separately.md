# Develop backend and fronend separately

## Context and Problem Statement

We are building a web application called D-LAMA, which will be used for labeling data points of machine learning projects. We need to decide whether to develop the backend and frontend of the web app separately or together.

## Considered Options

* Developing backend and frontend together: Develop both backend and frontend together using a full-stack web framework.
* Developing backend and frontend separately: Develop backend and frontend separately using different frameworks.

## Decision Outcome

we have decided to develop the backend and frontend separately for the webapp D-LAMA. The decision was based on the following factors:

* Flexibility: Separating the frontend and backend will give us the flexibility to choose the best tools for each component, based on their strengths and weaknesses.
* Maintenance: Developing the backend and frontend separately will make it easier to maintain and modify each component, without affecting the other.
* Specialization: Developing the backend and frontend separately will allow our team members to specialize in their respective areas.
