## Frontend Framework Analysis

In the frontend team, the decision was made to develop with React.
However, the question arose as to whether we wanted to use a UI framework for this, and if so, which one.
The three UI frameworks Ionic, React-Native and Material were analysed for their opportunities and risks.

### Ionic
Ionic is an open source framework that is easy to learn and use. It contains an extensive library of ready-made components. It is also possible to develop
to develop applications across platforms. Due to the existence of an active developer community, there is sufficient support available for questions or problems. 
However, Ionic can be somewhat slower for complex applications compared to competing products.

### React Native
React Native is also an open source framework developed by Facebook.
It offers native performance and uses a popular and established library (React) as a basis.
In addition, as with the Ionic framework, it is possible to develop cross-platform applications.
However, React Native is more difficult to learn than Ionic and offers only a limited library of prefabricated components.

### Material Design
Material Design is a design system developed by Google. It 
contains an extensive library of prefabricated components and allows rapid development of applications.
However, Material Design was primarily developed for web application development and can be limited when developing mobile applications.
In addition, cross-platform development is not possible.

### Conclusion
After analysing the three frameworks, the frontend team decided to use the Ionic framework for the development of the D-Lama frontend.
Since Ionic was developed especially for the use of mobile-first applications, can be developed across all
platform and is easy to learn even for beginners, it is the ideal Ui framework for D-Lama.
