# Project Outline



## 1 Starting Point

Thanks to AI, many processes are currently being simplified and many new projects are being implemented. Supervised Learning plays a big role in this, as it is a common use case or at least a component of most AI networks. Last semester we visited MLDM and realized that labeling data takes a lot of time and is not very satisfying. This is something we are trying to change! 

To make manual labeling on data for AI projects exciting and efficient we are developing a simple web application that makes labeling as well as letting everyone label accessible. With the swipe mechanism, labeling is simplified and through gamification, quality as well as quantity is measured in a fun way. Thanks to configuration options, clients should also have an exciting experience and get their data more efficiently.

## 2 Idea

The idea of developing a software tool for data labeling to train supervised learning neural networks is a very promising one. Data labeling is an essential task in supervised machine learning that requires a significant amount of time and effort. Automated labeling does not work really good in many cases so the effort has to be made by humans. To keep them interested and increase their quality and quantity a gamification and simple user experience is essential.

The benefits of such a tool are clear. It can help businesses develop machine learning models faster and more efficiently, which can ultimately improve their competitiveness in their respective industries.

However, as with any technology product, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main risks of data labeling is the potential for inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the labeling process. This can lead to the development of inaccurate or unethical machine learning models, which can be costly for businesses.

To mitigate this risk, there should be a control mechanism and a pointing system which motivates the data lablers to deliver the best quality they possibly can.

A person who wants to have data labeld needs to be able to upload different datatypes such as video, pictures, text and audio with ease and choose the necessary labels.

The person who wants to label a dataset shall be able to do that via swiping in the direction of a previously set label (inspired by tinder) with a maximum of four labels at a time (up, down, left, right).

## 3 Customer Benefit

The software will help businesses and research labs reduce the time and resources required to develop machine learning models. It will allow them to label dataset quicker by a decentralized method and at the same time get a good mix of different opinions, which in the intended case leads to a more stable dataset. 

1. Faster development of machine learning models: Data labeling is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. By decentralizing the data labeling process, businesses can significantly reduce the time and effort required to develop machine learning models. This can help businesses get their products and services to market faster, giving them a competitive edge in their industry.
2. Increased accuracy and consistency: Different quality control measurements and the mixture of lablers can help reduce the potential for error and bias in the labeling process. This can lead to more accurate and consistent labeling, which can improve the overall quality of the machine learning models. This can be especially important in industries where accuracy is critical, such as healthcare, finance, and legal.
3. Scalability: Decentralized data labeling can be scaled easily, allowing businesses to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This can be especially important for businesses that need to process large datasets on a regular basis.

## 4 Competitive Analysis
Due to the increasing importance of machine learning algorithms, tools have been developed on the market to simplify and improve the quality of manual data labelling.
