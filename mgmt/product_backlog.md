| ID | Epic | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Story Points | Priority | Status | For whom? |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1011 | Development | As Dina, I want to fix the technology stack so I can start developing cleanly. | Options are analyzed and it has been decided for the best. | 0 | 0 | Planned | 游댮 |
| 1016 | Frontend | As Dina, I want to create initial mockups so that I can visually ensure an appealing look and feel for the Eduardo and Hanna. | <ul><li>All views are defined</li><li>Every team member reviews them and Hanna and Eduardo like it</li></ul> | 8 | 1 | Planned | 游댮 |
| 1013 | Architecture | As Dina, I want to have a structured development process so that there can be as few hurdles as possible and a high quality process / code from the start | <ul><li>Coding guidelines are available</li><li>Issue management is clear and standardized</li></ul> | 3 | 1 | Planned | 游댮 |
| 1018 | Architecture | As Dina, I would like to have an architectural drawing so that I have an overview of interfaces and contact points of the various services. | <ul><li>Frontend structure is clear (services, components, interceptors)</li><li>Communication between FE and BE is clear</li><li>Backend with DB connection and abstraction patterns are elaborated</li></ul> | 5 | 1 | Planned | 游댮 |
| 1019 | Management | As Dina, I want to create a wiki and product outline so that during development and also after the main development phase, I know what functionalities are given and how to contribute to them. (e.g. REST interfaces) | <ul><li>Wiki skeleton is made</li><li>Product Backlog is in Wiki</li><li>Planning and Management templates are done</li></ul> | 8 | 1 | Planned | 游댮 |
| 1020 | DevOps | As Dina, I want to have a running Kubernetes cluster or VM so that the software can be rolled out. | <ul><li>First "example" deployment is done</li><li>GitOPS CICD is elaborated</li><li>Decision VM vs K8s is made</li></ul> | 5 | 1 | Backlog | 游댮 |
| 1002 | Development | As Eduardo, I want to be able to easily categorize data using a swipe mechanism so I can label data as quickly and intuitively as possible. |  |  | 1 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| 1005 | Development | As Hanna, I want to be able to upload a container of records with the possible categories so that the lablers can use them. | - | - | 1 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| 1004 | Development | As Hanna I want to be able to see an evaluation of the gelable data, so that I can quickly create an overview (e.g. annotator agreement). | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| 1008 | DevOps | As Dina, I want a DevOps process defined and implemented so that the rollout of the Productive System and Test System happens quickly and in a controlled manner. | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游댮 |
| 1007 | Development | As Eduardo or Hanna, I want to be able to register, so that I can generate a profile that I can access again and again. | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游릭游릮 |
| 1009 | Development | As Eduardo and Hanna, I want to be able to see the progress (how much of the data to be labeled is already labeled). Thereby as Kevin I should see my progress and as Katharina I want to see the progress of Kevin and Noah, but also an overall view | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游릭游릮 |
| 1014 | Development | As Hanna I want to download the labeled data via a button so I can use it e.g. in Python to do ML | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| 1003 | Development | As Eduardo, I want to get scores for my labeled data so I can see how much data I have already assigned to a category. | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| 1010 | Development | As a Eduardo, I would like to see a ranking of how much and how well I have labled versus other Eduardos so I can compete with them. | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| 1017 | Development | As Hanna, I would like to have a control algorithm that can check the quality of the labeld data from Eduardo so that I can exclude low-flyers to maintain data quality. (e.g. control question to which the answer is known). | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| 1021 | Development | As Hanna, I want to be able to make a labeling record public or private so I can control the audience who is labeling my data. | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| 1006 | Development | As Eduardo, I would like to have an overview of the labelig records and be able to choose one from them. | - | - | 4 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| 1012 | Development | As Hanna, I want to be able to upload different data formats (text, images, audio, video) so that Eduardo can label different records for different usecases. | - | - | 4 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| 1015 | Development | As Hanna, I would like to have a REST / gRPC interface so that I can use the labeled data directly without downloading them to feed an ML processes. | - | - | 4 | Backlog | 游릭 |
