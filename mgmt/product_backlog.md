| <p id="1020"> 1020 </p> | DevOps | As Dina, I want to have a running Kubernetes cluster or VM so that the software can be rolled out. | <ul><li>First "example" deployment is done</li><li>GitOPS CICD is elaborated</li><li>Decision VM vs K8s is made</li></ul> | 5 | 1 | Backlog | 游댮 |
| <p id="1002"> 1002 </p> | Development | As Eduardo, I want to be able to easily categorize data using a swipe mechanism so I can label data as quickly and intuitively as possible. |  |  | 1 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| <p id="1005"> 1005 </p> | Development | As Hanna, I want to be able to upload a container of records with the possible categories so that the lablers can use them. | - | - | 1 | Backlog | 游릭 |

| <p id="1009"> 1009 </p> | Development | As Eduardo and Hanna, I want to be able to see the progress (how much of the data to be labeled is already labeled). Thereby as Kevin I should see my progress and as Katharina I want to see the progress of Kevin and Noah, but also an overall view | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游릭游릮 |
| <p id="1014"> 1014 </p> | Development | As Hanna I want to download the labeled data via a button so I can use it e.g. in Python to do ML | - | - | 2 | Backlog | 游릭 |
| <p id="1003"> 1003 </p> | Development | As Eduardo, I want to get scores for my labeled data so I can see how much data I have already assigned to a category. | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| <p id="1010"> 1010 </p> | Development | As a Eduardo, I would like to see a ranking of how much and how well I have labled versus other Eduardos so I can compete with them. | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릮 |
| <p id="1017"> 1017 </p> | Development | As Hanna, I would like to have a control algorithm that can check the quality of the labeld data from Eduardo so that I can exclude low-flyers to maintain data quality. (e.g. control question to which the answer is known). | - | - | 3 | Backlog | 游릭 |
