# Definition of Done (DoD)
DoD is a shared understanding between the development team, stakeholders, and customers of what it means to complete a software project. The DoD describes the criteria that must be met before a feature or a user story can be considered complete and ready for release.



1. Code complete: All code changes associated with the feature or user story have been written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch of the code repository.
2. Automated tests: Appropriate automated tests have been written, and all tests are passing in the local development environment as well as in the continuous integration (CI) environment.
3. Documentation: All necessary documentation has been written and updated, including user manuals, API documentation, and release notes.
4. Code review: The code changes have been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. The review feedback has been addressed, and the changes have been re-reviewed as needed.
5. Acceptance criteria met: The feature or user story meets all of the acceptance criteria defined by the customer or product owner. Any additional criteria specified by the development team are also met.
6. Integration testing: The feature or user story has been tested in the integration environment, and any issues that arise have been addressed.
7. Performance testing: Any performance-related issues have been identified and addressed, and the feature or user story meets the required performance standards.
8. Security testing: Any security-related issues have been identified and addressed, and the feature or user story meets the required security standards.
9. Deployment: The feature or user story has been successfully deployed to the staging environment, and any issues that arise have been addressed.
10. User acceptance testing (UAT): The feature or user story has been tested by the customer or product owner, and any issues that arise have been addressed.
