## Hi there, welcome to D-LAMA 👋

🙋‍♀️ About us - We are studying Computer Science at ZHAW and for the module PM4 we are developing an application to make the labeling process of data for supervised learning more exciting and simpler.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - Currently only members of the group can contribute. For this, an issue can be selected and implemented. for more info check the [detailed guildelines](#cd).

👩‍💻 Useful resources - All our docs are written directly in the code or in this repository:

<details>
  <summary id="cd"><h2>Contribution guidelines</h2></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick an issue you'd like to tackle and assign it to you.</li>
    <li>Create a new branch from main to work on the issue with it's correct tag (e.g. feat/issue_1).</li>
    <li>If one issue depends from another issue take that branch as base (dependent issues can happen, should be avoided at all costs).</li>
    <li>Prefix every commit you are making as suggested in <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work">semantic release</a> and add a meaningful description.</li>
    <li>Check the coding guidelines (link follows) for a clean and maintainable code</li>
    <li>If you have solved the issue, let it review from min. one other person.</li>
    <li>As a reviewer, make sure you point out what was good, what was bad and how you'd do it differently. Also make sure you take time for a review, because they are very important for consistency and maintainability.</li>
  </ul>
