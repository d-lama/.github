## Hi there, welcome to D-LAMA üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About us - We are studying Computer Science at ZHAW and for the module PM4 we are developing an application to make the labeling process of data for supervised learning more exciting and simpler.

üåà Contribution guidelines - Currently only members of the group can contribute. For this, an issue can be selected and implemented. for more info check the [detailed guildelines](#cd).

üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - All our docs are written directly in the code or in this repository:
* [Recent Weekly Standup](/weekly/23_30_03.md) | [List](/weekly)
* Project Outline [Markdown](/mgmt/project_outline.md) | [PDF](/mgmt/project_outline.pdf)
* [Product Backlog](/mgmt/product_backlog.md)
* Issue Boards for [Service](https://github.com/orgs/d-lama/projects/2) | [Webapp](https://github.com/orgs/d-lama/projects/4) | [Operations](https://github.com/orgs/d-lama/projects/5)
* [Wiki](/tech)

ü¶ô If you figure out what D-LAMA stands for write it in here and make a merge request ü¶ô

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

<details>
  <summary id="cd"><h2>Contribution guidelines</h2></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Pick an issue you'd like to tackle and assign it to you.</li>
    <li>Create a new branch from main to work on the issue with it's correct tag (e.g. feat/issue_1).</li>
    <li>If one issue depends from another issue take that branch as base (dependent issues can happen, should be avoided at all costs).</li>
    <li>Prefix every commit you are making as suggested in <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#how-does-it-work">semantic release</a> and add a meaningful description.</li>
    <li>Check the coding guidelines (link follows) for a clean and maintainable code</li>
    <li>If you have solved the issue, let it review from min. one other person.</li>
    <li>As a reviewer, make sure you point out what was good, what was bad and how you'd do it differently. Also make sure you take time for a review, because they are very important for consistency and maintainability.</li>
  </ul>
